# Java-Practice-Programs
THIS JAVA PROJECT CONTAINS A COLLECTION OF SIMPLE AND BEGINNER-FRIENDLY PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO HELP LEARNERS UNDERSTAND FUNDAMENTAL JAVA CONCEPTS AND PRACTICE CORE SYNTAX. THE PROJECT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO CATEGORIES: SIMPLE JAVA PROGRAMS AND ENCAPSULATION-BASED PROGRAMS. EACH PROGRAM ADDRESSES A SPECIFIC TASK AND DEMONSTRATES A UNIQUE CONCEPT THROUGH CLEAN, STRUCTURED CODE. BELOW IS THE NUMBERED LIST OF TASKS INCLUDED IN THIS PROJECT:

SIMPLE JAVA PROGRAMS:

1. HELLO WORLD: PRINTS "HELLO, WORLD!" TO THE CONSOLE TO VERIFY JAVA SETUP AND OUTPUT FUNCTIONALITY.

2. SUM OF TWO NUMBERS: ACCEPTS TWO INTEGERS FROM THE USER AND DISPLAYS THEIR SUM USING BASIC ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS AND INPUT HANDLING.

3. CHECK EVEN OR ODD: CHECKS WHETHER A USER-ENTERED INTEGER IS EVEN OR ODD USING MODULUS OPERATOR AND CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS.

4. FACTORIAL OF A NUMBER: CALCULATES THE FACTORIAL OF A POSITIVE INTEGER BY MULTIPLYING NUMBERS FROM 1 TO N USING A LOOP.

5. PALINDROME CHECKER: CHECKS WHETHER A GIVEN STRING IS A PALINDROME BY COMPARING CHARACTERS FROM BOTH ENDS USING LOOPING AND CONDITION CHECKS.

6. ARRAY ELEMENT SEARCH: TAKES AN ARRAY OF INTEGERS AND A KEY AS INPUT, THEN SEARCHES FOR THAT KEY IN THE ARRAY USING A FOR LOOP AND DISPLAYS ITS INDEX IF FOUND.

7. SIMPLE CALCULATOR: PERFORMS BASIC OPERATIONS (ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION) BASED ON USER-ENTERED OPERATOR AND OPERANDS USING SWITCH-CASE.

8. MULTIPLICATION TABLE: PRINTS THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE (1 TO 10) OF A NUMBER ENTERED BY THE USER USING A LOOP STRUCTURE.

ENCAPSULATION PROGRAMS:

9. STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM: DEFINES A STUDENT CLASS WITH PRIVATE FIELDS FOR NAME, ROLL NUMBER, AND GRADE, AND USES PUBLIC GETTER AND SETTER METHODS TO PROTECT AND ACCESS THESE FIELDS. VALUES ARE SET AND DISPLAYED THROUGH METHOD CALLS TO DEMONSTRATE DATA ENCAPSULATION.

10. BANK ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT: CREATES A BANKACCOUNT CLASS WITH A PRIVATE BALANCE FIELD AND PUBLIC METHODS TO HANDLE DEPOSIT, WITHDRAWAL, AND BALANCE CHECKING. IT ENSURES THAT BALANCE CANNOT GO NEGATIVE AND SHOWS UPDATED BALANCE AFTER EACH OPERATION THROUGH VALIDATION AND OUTPUT STATEMENTS.

OVERALL, THESE TEN PROGRAMS PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE STARTING POINT FOR BEGINNERS IN JAVA PROGRAMMING, HELPING THEM BUILD A STRONG FOUNDATION IN LOGIC DEVELOPMENT, INPUT/OUTPUT HANDLING, CONTROL STRUCTURES, AND OBJECT-ORIENTED PRINCIPLES LIKE ENCAPSULATION. EACH TASK IS SELF-CONTAINED AND WRITTEN IN A BEGINNER-FRIENDLY MANNER TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING AND HANDS-ON PRACTICE.
